#Saralis Rivera's GPS 1 Reflection

**What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?**

*Prior to the GPS session, I felt that I had a soild understanding of the benefits for utilzing git. I did, however, struggle with the workflow and truly understanding all aspects of the steps ie: knowing when and why to git pull, git status, create a feature branch and ensuring branches a merged properly.*

**What concepts were clarified during the GPS?**

*I have a better understanding of the git pull and feature branch process from the session. Though all steps are important, I find these to be critical pieces I've forgotten in practice that have really caused confusion for me over the last week.*

**What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?**

*During the session, I asked thoughts about approach and for confirmation on command line spelling/format while driving. When I was stuck at points, I also asked about what code being entered would do.*


**What still confuses you about git?**

*Ensuring all merges that are necessary occur is still not second nature to me. I find myself wondering why I get messages noting the feature branch has not been full merged sometimes. I still need to ensure I understand all steps of the process.*

**How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?**

*It was a positive experience. I appreciated working with my pair as he was very easy to collaborate with and willing to provide answers to questions I had. He provided guidance when I didn't entirely understand what was next in the process.*
