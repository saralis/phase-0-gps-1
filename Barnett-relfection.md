#**Phillip Barnett's GPS 1.1 Reflection**

###What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
Although I had gotten comfortable with the git workflow, I was a bit apprahensive about how it would work once starting to work with others. I was also a little unclear about merge conflicts and what to do if something went wrong.

###What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
The concept of the git workflow with multiple developers was definetly clarified. I feel much more comfortable having gone through the process and my pair and I went through it a few additional times to test out somethings and make sure we understood it. The issue of merge conflicts and how to fix them was also clarified during this process. Just going through it a couple times helped to understand and prepare me for what may happen in the future. Hopefully if I continue to do the proper git workflow it wont happen.

###What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
I asked about being able to cotinually push a feature branch to the origin on GitHub before merging it to the master branch. The guide answered my question and we were able to see how it works as we did it a few times. I also asked my pair about how to do the inline image and we were able to get it to dispay correctly after a few tries.

###What still confuses you about git?
In trying to push to the origin a message came up about a change for push in Git 2.0 that changed push to two options, push.default matching and push.default simple. My pair and I discussed it and it seems like simple is the better and safer option, but we were both a little confused. We feel better after some research, but also still feel a bit confused about fast fowarding in git merging.

###How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS? I really enjoyed my first GPS. My pair was great and we worked together really well. We both seemed focus on trying to learn rather than just complete the task which was helpful. The guide was also great. We didn't need much help from him so he stayed in the background most of the time observing. He did jump in however when we needed some guidance to point us in the right direction and helped to answer the couple questions we did have. It was beneficial that I was fairly comfortable with the git workflow coming into this GPS, but I am curious how it will go when I am not so comfortable with the topic.
